### Apps and Packages

- 

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [commitlint]

## Commits

This repo follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Commit Types

The commit types are based on [Conventional Changelog Metahub](https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-changelog-metahub).

### Commit Scopes

Scopes should match the path(s) to the package/app the commit alters.

#### Examples

```markdown
feat(apps/earth): this is a commit for the earth app

....

feat(packages/eslint-config,packages/tsconfig): this is a commit to multiple packages (multi-scoped commits should be avoided when possible)

....

config(apps/earth,eslint): this is a commit that changes the eslint config for the earth app
```

## Commands

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
cd earth
npm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
cd earth
npm run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```sh
cd earth
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```sh
npx turbo link
```
